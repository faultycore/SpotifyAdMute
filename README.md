# spotify-ad-mute
Console application that mutes Spotify during an ad and unmutes as soon as the ad is finished.

It only works on Windows with the Spotify desktop app (not Spotify web).

Mainly this is a personal project - it's not meant as a serious replacement/competitor to other Spotify automation programs that exist.
